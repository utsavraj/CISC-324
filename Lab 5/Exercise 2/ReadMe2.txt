ANSWER FOR QUESTION ONEOutput is either Producing A ...Producing B ...Producing C ...Producing D ...ORProducing A ...Producing B ...Am inside GetConsuming A ...Am inside GetConsuming B ...Am inside GetFor the first output. Producer is adding letters to the buffer and once, it fills the buffer, it is stuck in the while loop.For the second output, Producer only puts A,B (and does not fill the buffer by adding C,D) in the buffer before Consumer is started. Hence, it consumes both of the letter before emptying the buffer and getting stuck in the while loop. ANSWER FOR QUESTION TWOOutput is Am inside Get

This is because producer is not initialised and therefore, the buffer is empty for the Consumer. Hence, after running the print statement, Consumer is stuck in the while loop.
